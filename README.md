# Untitled Troll

## Features
Untitled Troll currently has:
 - An Ore name Yiorite Ore (try looking at it) 
 - An item named Yiorite Ingot (just be careful with it)
 - A Trapped Yiorite Ore Block
 - Trapped block recipes through json files
 - A stat that shows how long you've been weirdly staring at a Yiorite Ore
 - An Item named "Stinky Mud" which you can cover Yiorite Blocks with
 - And a creative inventory item UI

## Todo List
The things that I want to add to this mod are:
 - A stone golem that can protect you from the Yiorite
 - An item named "Stone Chunk" to feed the golem
 - Some more utilities to the Trapped Yiorite Ore
 - And some more funny and/or annoying things
