# Untitled Troll

## Features
Untitled Troll currently has:
 - An Ore name Yiorite Ore (try looking at it) 
 - An item named Yiorite Ingot (just be careful with it)
 - A Trapped Yiorite Ore Block that is still in development
 - And a stat that shows how long you've been weirdly staring at a Yiorite Ore

## Todo List
The things that I want to add to this mod are:
 - A stone golem that can protect you from the Yiorite
 - An item named "Stone Chunk" to feed the golem
 - Some utilities to the Trapped Yiorite Ore
 - A working UI to access all the items of this mod
 - And some more funny and/or annoying things
